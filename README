OpenSource CPAP Analysis Reporter - OSCAR

OSCAR is a derivative of SleepyHead version 1.1.0, created when that was abandoned by Mark Watkins.

SleepyHead was a cross platform, opensource sleep tracking program for reviewing CPAP and Oximetry data,
which are devices used in the treatment of Sleep Disorders like Obstructive Sleep Apnea. It was released
under the GPL version 3 license. See the file COPYING for those details.

SleepyHead was written by Mark Watkins (aka Jedimark), an Australian software developer afflicted with sleep apnea.

SleepyHead was copyright (C) 2011-2018 by Mark Watkins <mark@jedimark.net>

Redistribution of derivatives ( a note added by Mark Watkins )
-----------------------------
Mark Watkins created this software to help lessen the exploitation of others. Seeing his work being used to exploit others
is incredibly un-motivational, and incredibly disrespectful of all the work he put into this project.

If you plan on reselling any derivatives of SleepyHead, I specifically request that you give due credit and
link back, mentioning clearly in your advertising material, software installer and about screens that your
derivative "is based on the free and open-source software SleepyHead available from http://sleepyhead.jedimark.net,
developed and copyright by Mark Watkins (C) 2011-2018."

It is not enough to reference that your derivative "is based on GPL software".
