  <p><b>OSCAR</b> is a derivative of the SleepyHead program written by Mark Watkins, during the years 2011 to 2018. The current project is the combined effort of people from CPAPtalk.com, ApneaBoard.com, and other volunteers, starting in 2019.</p>
  <p><b>OpenSource Libraries</b> <br />
  OSCAR uses the OpenSource version of the Qt cross-platform toolkit available from 
  <a href="http://qt.io" target="_blank">http://qt.io</a> which itself draws from many smaller open source libraries. You can read the individual licensing for many of these components that are used under the hood of OSCAR at 
  <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/licenses-used-in-qt.html" target="_blank">https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/licenses-used-in-qt.html</a></p>
  <p><b>Data formats</b> <br />
  The CPAP device data formats are mostly undocumented. Getting them working in OSCAR involved a lot of investigation, together with a lot of SD card data samples, many patient users willing to put up with crashes and data issues, and plenty of help from fellow developers out there who shared in the workload of decoding data formats. 
  <i>Thanks to all of you who have helped in the fight to protect our right to keep our own data open and accessible!</i></p>
