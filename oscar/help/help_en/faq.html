<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3><a href="#supportmymachine">Why doesn't OSCAR support [insert
obscure/new device] yet?</a></h3>
<p><a href="#supportmymachine">Plenty of reasons.. Pick your favourite:</a></p>
<list>
<li><a href="#supportmymachine">• Because the 5 people who own one
can't supply enough data to see all possible event codes?</a></li>
<li><a href="#supportmymachine">• Because it doesn't feature a flow
waveform and would be boring?</a></li>
<li><a href="#supportmymachine">• Because one unpaid developer can only
hack, create, and maintain so many importers before they go insane?</a></li>
<li><a href="#supportmymachine">• Because to get it right takes a
really, really big number of developer man-hours that would be better
spent on other parts of the program?</a></li>
<li><a href="#supportmymachine">• Because the build quality perhaps is
garbage and nobody should own one?</a></li>
<li><a href="#supportmymachine">• Because nobody else is interested in
helping hack the formats?</a></li>
<li><a href="#supportmymachine">• Because I prefer hands on and rarely
get to play with/hack on the hardware directly?</a></li>
</list>

<h3><a href="#compliance">Why doesn't OSCAR let me generate <i>compliance</i>
reports?</a></h3>
<p><a href="#compliance">Mainly, to avoid attracting the lawsuits that
would inevitably come from offering this capability. Here are the
primary reasons why I'm dead against it:</a></p>
<list>
<li><a href="#compliance">• It's far too easy to change the source code
to fake compliance reports.</a></li>
<li><a href="#compliance">• Do you like the idea of sharing the road
with truck drivers with an untreated sleep disorder who faked
compliance data?</a></li>
<li><a href="#compliance">• Data Formats of CPAP machines in OSCAR had
to be reverse engineered because manufacturers don't release
documentation, and accuracy can't be guaranteed.</a></li>
<li><a href="#compliance">• To do it would require closing the
sourcecode and establishing a relationship with manufacturers who have
proven they care very little about data access rights.</a></li>
</list>
<p><a href="#compliance">This stuff is also the reason I never bothered
hacking CPAP data Checksums... If they were public knowledge, people
could alter SD data card content, which would not be cool.</a></p>
